# WeatherLens (Android Application)

You can track your current location's weather with this app with the swipe of a card. You can swipe either left or right to see the next day's weather. It gives you the temperature, humidity, pressure, and UV index for your location for eight days in the form of cards.
If you like the wallpaper that you're seeing in the background of a card you can simply press the button at the bottom to set that as your background.
There is a settings tab to customize the units of measurement for all the information, and also has links to check out about me or more about the app. 
This app is still in its early stages so feel free to contribute here or provide feedback here or in Play Store.
